Connect to Strava API in order to create ride-related segment leaderboard

After organizing a group ride, all the members are uploading their activity to Strava.
Then, we are collecting data coming from these activities, focusing on some interested segments. Based on the performances on these segments, we are creating rankings and assigning points to the riders.
These points are creating and defining a final leaderboard, defining the cumulative ranking.
